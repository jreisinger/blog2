      <title>runp: run shell commands in parallel</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m using shell (bash specifically) on daily basis. From time to time a need arises to run multiple commands in parallel. For example my .bashrc runs commands like these to download or clone vim plugins I use:
curl -L -o $HOME/.git-completion.bash https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash rm -rf $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start/grep.vim &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git clone https://github.com/yegappan/grep.git $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start/grep.vim # https://tpaschalis.github.io/vim-go-setup/ rm -rf $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-go &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git clone https://github.com/fatih/vim-go.git $HOME/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-go The problem is that these commmands run sequentially and it takes a while until they are done.</description>

      <title>Perl one-liners</title>

      <description>Introduction to Perl one-liners I think Perl one-liners are still super useful. They are small Perl programs that are run directly from command line. Like this one from the Kubernetes job documentation:
perl -Mbignum=bpi -wle &amp;#34;print bpi(2000)&amp;#34; perl is the Perl language interpreter. -M and -wle are command line switches (or options) that modify the perl&amp;rsquo;s behaviour. See below for explanation of what they mean. The string within double quotes is the Perl code that gets executed.</description>

      <description>How to write tests for a Perl script At $work, I was to upgrade several Debians from Squeezy through Wheezy to Jessie (6 to 8). I wanted to be sure that after the upgrade (mostly) the same processes are running as before. I whipped up a script, that simply stores the list of running processes before the upgrade. When run subsequently it reports missing processes (if any).
To make the script reliable and easy to maintain I wanted to test it somehow.</description>

      <description>My First CPAN Contribution Last week I uploaded App::Monport to CPAN. I did it to try out the CPAN toolchain and to get a feeling of accomplishment :-). But I also think the application might be useful to some folks.
Update: My application was mentioned in PerlTricks&amp;rsquo; article. Cool!</description>
